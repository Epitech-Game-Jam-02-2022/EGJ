Tasked is a game made in a week end during a Game Jam.
In this game, you control an office worker, who has to do several tasks in a limited time in order to gain skills and to succeed in his professional career.
There are several levels and several tasks to do.

***You can use those keys in the game :***
- The arrows or W, A, S, D : to move the player
- Escape : to pause the game
- E : to interact

To fulfill the tasks, you have to find the objects linked to the tasks (outlined in white), then start the process by interacting with it, and then when the loadbar is full, you will have to interact with it again to complete the task.

***Thank you for reading, have a nice time playing Tasked!***
